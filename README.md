This repository contains a client and server codebase. 

## Server Repository:

This codebase contains a list of laws (`docs/laws.pdf`) taken from the fictional series “Game of Thrones” (randomly pulled from a wiki fandom site... unfortunately knowledge of the series does not provide an edge on this assignment). Your task is to implement a new service (described in take home exercise document) and provide access to that service via a FastAPI endpoint running in a docker container. Please replace this readme with the steps required to run your app.

## Client Repository 

In the `frontend` folder you'll find a light NextJS app with it's own README including instructions to run. Your task here is to build a minimal client experience that utilizes the service build in part 1.
